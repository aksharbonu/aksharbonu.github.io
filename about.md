I'm currently building [Hotline] (https://www.hellohotline.com), a fan engagement tool using messaging platforms.

I previously founded Masquerade, a pseudo-anonymous social application. It anonymously matched two friends in chat allowing the two to mutually reveal their identities should they choose.

Before that, I founded InstaNomz, a food delivery service for businesses that do not deliver. We launched at Harvard University in early 2014 but were [shut down shortly after] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-18/harvard-university-thwarts-freshman-entrepreneurs).

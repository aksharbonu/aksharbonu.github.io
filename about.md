I'm currently working on [Hotline](https://www.hellohotline.com). It allows influencers, broadly defined as anyone that commands an audience, to engage with their audience using messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and SMS. We are fortunate to be funded by Pejman Mar Ventures.

I previously founded Masquerade, a pseudo-anonymous chat application. It anonymously matched two friends then allowing the two to mutually reveal their identities after chatting. We were humbled to be supported by Facebook through its FBStart Accelerate program.

Before that, I founded InstaNomz, a food delivery service for businesses that do not deliver. We launched at Harvard University in early 2014 but were [shut down shortly after](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-18/harvard-university-thwarts-freshman-entrepreneurs).

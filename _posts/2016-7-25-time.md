I am running out of time.

Doing anything meaningful takes time. Building [Hotline](www.hellohotline.com) takes time. It has taken us 5 months to get to where we are today. We need more time -- much more time -- to get to where we want to be.

In 36 days, if I do not return to school, I have then 14 days to leave the country. 50 days. I could extend that number. 80, 90, 100... Expensive tricks, though. Getting a visa is tough.

It seems, then, to buy time I must give time. I will return to school for my final year. Graduating gives me 3 additional years -- 36 months -- to remain in this country.

The clock is ticking. 49 months left.
